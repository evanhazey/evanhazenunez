Hello hello. I am a joint UC Presidents/Cal-Bridge Postdoctoral Fellow at UCLA (mentors: Alice Shapley, Tommaso Treu) and a visiting Postdoctoral Fellow at Carnegie Observatories. I received my PhD from [Caltech Astronomy](https://www.astro.caltech.edu) (Advisors: Chuck Steidel, Evan Kirby), earned my BS in Physics with a specialization in Astrophysics from [California State Polytechnic University, Pomona](https://www.cpp.edu/~sci/physics-astronomy/) (magna cum laude; Advisors: Matt Povich, Breanna Binder), and earned an AST in Physics (and 6 other associates; magna cum laude) from [El Camino College](https://www.elcamino.edu/academics/naturalsciences/physics/). I am biracial (African-American and Mexican), grew up in Southern California (Carson, CA then Torrance, CA; family from Compton), and am very family-oriented. My main goals in life are to do right by those I come into contact with, learn as much about the universe as I can, share that knowledge with as many people as I can, and to keep looking up.


My Current Research

Thesis: Directly observing the baryon cycle during the peak of cosmic star formation rate density (z=2-3): Detecting and tracing the hydrogen and metals in high redshift galaxies' interstellar and circumgalactic medium. More details including a report and a presentation can be found [here](research.md).

First Year Project: [Placing empirical constraints on the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) yields of zero to low metallicity massive stars using Very Metal-Poor Damped Lyman Alpha Absorbers](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...927...64N/abstract) (VMP DLAs). More details, a qual report, and link to the paper can be found [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...927...64N/abstract) and in [Research](research.md). 


All current/previous researched topics
- High redshift (z=2-3) galaxy scale baryon cycle, high-z circumgalactic medium, high-z galaxy evolution
- DLA Host galaxies, Quasar absorption system host galaxies, Lyman Break Galaxies 
- Galactic Chemical Evolution, Zero-/Low-Metallicity Core Collapse Supernova yields, Very-Metal Poor Damped Lyman-Alpha Absorbers
- Stellar Population Synthesis Models, Stellar Evolution, Massive Stars (Modeling Project that used UV, Visible and IR Data)
- Pre-Main Sequence Stars, Young Stellar Objects (IR and X-ray data)
- Quasars, high redshift quasars, observational cosmology (Visible Data)
