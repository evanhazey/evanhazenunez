I am a Physics student at [California State Polytechnic University, Pomona](https://www.cpp.edu/~sci/physics-astronomy/) currently applying for graduate school in Astronomy/Astrophysics.

I have researched the following topics
- Quasars, high redshift quasars, observational cosmology (Optical Data)
- Pre-Main Sequence Stars, Young Stellar Objects (IR and X-ray)
- Stellar Population Synthesis Models, Stellar Evolution, Massive Stars (Modeling Project that used Visible/IR Data)

I am interested in these topics as well as 
1. Galaxy Evolution/Formation
2. Observational Cosmology
3. Young Stellar Objects, Stellar evolution
