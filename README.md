Hello hello. I am a PhD student at [Caltech Astronomy](https://www.astro.caltech.edu). I previously attended [El Camino College](https://www.elcamino.edu/academics/naturalsciences/physics/) where I earned an AS in Physics (magna cum laude), then finished at [California State Polytechnic University, Pomona](https://www.cpp.edu/~sci/physics-astronomy/) earning my BS in Physics (magna cum laude). I am biracial (African-American and Mexican), grew up in Southern California (Carson, CA then Torrance, CA), and am very family-oriented. My main goals in life are to learn as much about the universe as I can, to share that knowledge with others, to do right by those I come into contact with, and to stay true to myself. Progress and good vibes.


My Current Research

Placing empirical constraints on the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) yields of massive stars using Very Metal-Poor Damped Lyman ALpha Absorbers (VMP DLAs). VMP DLAs offer a unique way to probe the near primordial gas of protogalaxires that have been predominantly enriched by CCSN. 


All current/previous researched topics
- Galactic Chemical Evolution, Zero-Metallicity Core Collapse Supernova yields, Very-Metal Poor Damped Lyman-Alpha Absorber
- Stellar Population Synthesis Models, Stellar Evolution, Massive Stars (Modeling Project that used UV, Visible and IR Data)
- Pre-Main Sequence Stars, Young Stellar Objects (IR and X-ray data)
- Quasars, high redshift quasars, observational cosmology (Visible Data)


<!I am interested in the following topics 
1. Galactic Chemical Evolution
2. Young Stellar Objects, Stellar evolution
3. Galaxy Evolution/Formation
4. Observational Cosmology>
