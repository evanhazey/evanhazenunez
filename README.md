Hello hello. I am a PhD candidate at [Caltech Astronomy](https://www.astro.caltech.edu). I previously attended [El Camino College](https://www.elcamino.edu/academics/naturalsciences/physics/) where I earned an AS in Physics (magna cum laude), then matriculated to [California State Polytechnic University, Pomona](https://www.cpp.edu/~sci/physics-astronomy/) to earn my BS in Physics (magna cum laude). I am biracial (African-American and Mexican), grew up in Southern California (Carson, CA then Torrance, CA), and am very family-oriented. My main goals in life are to do right by my loved ones and those I come into contact with, learn as much about the universe as I can, to share that knowledge with others, and to stay true to myself. Progress and vibes.


My Current Research

Thesis: Directly observing the baryon cycle during the peak of cosmic star formation rate density (z=2-3). More details can be found in [Research].

First Year Project: [Placing empirical constraints on the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) yields of zero to low metallicity massive stars using Very Metal-Poor Damped Lyman Alpha Absorbers](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...927...64N/abstract) (VMP DLAs). More details, a qual report, and link to the paper can be found [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...927...64N/abstract) and in [Research](research.md). 


All current/previous researched topics
- High redshift (z=2-3) galaxy evolution, DLA Host galaxies, Quasar absorption system host galaxies (Absorber-Host Galaxies), Lyman Break Galaxies, high redshift circumgalactic medium and interstellar medium 
- Galactic Chemical Evolution, Zero-Metallicity Core Collapse Supernova yields, Very-Metal Poor Damped Lyman-Alpha Absorber
- Stellar Population Synthesis Models, Stellar Evolution, Massive Stars (Modeling Project that used UV, Visible and IR Data)
- Pre-Main Sequence Stars, Young Stellar Objects (IR and X-ray data)
- Quasars, high redshift quasars, observational cosmology (Visible Data)
