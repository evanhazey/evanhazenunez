I am a Physics student with a deep lover for astronomy at [California State Polytechnic University, Pomona](https://www.cpp.edu/~sci/physics-astronomy/) currently applying for graduate school in Astronomy/Astrophysics. For those that are curious my ethniciy is African-American and Mexican.

I have researched the following topics
- Stellar Population Synthesis Models, Stellar Evolution, Massive Stars (Modeling Project that used UV, Visible and IR Data)
- Pre-Main Sequence Stars, Young Stellar Objects (IR and X-ray data)
- Quasars, high redshift quasars, observational cosmology (Visible Data)


I am interested in the following topics 
1. Galaxy Evolution/Formation
2. Observational Cosmology
3. Young Stellar Objects, Stellar evolution
