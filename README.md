I am a Physics student with a deep love for astronomy at [California State Polytechnic University, Pomona](https://www.cpp.edu/~sci/physics-astronomy/) currently applying for graduate school in Astronomy/Astrophysics. I am biracial (African-American and Mexican), grew up in Southern California (Carson, CA then Torrance, CA), and am very family-oriented. My main goals in life is to learn as much about the universe as I can, share that knowledge with others, and to do right by those I come into contact with. Progress and good vibes.

I have researched the following topics
- Stellar Population Synthesis Models, Stellar Evolution, Massive Stars (Modeling Project that used UV, Visible and IR Data)
- Pre-Main Sequence Stars, Young Stellar Objects (IR and X-ray data)
- Quasars, high redshift quasars, observational cosmology (Visible Data)


I am interested in the following topics 
1. Galaxy Evolution/Formation
2. Observational Cosmology
3. Young Stellar Objects, Stellar evolution
