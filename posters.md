REU = Research Experience for Undergraduates


## Cal Poly Pomona

Summer 2017 I began researching at my home institution Cal Poly Pomona with Professor Matthew Povich and Postdoctoral Fellow (now Assistant Professor) Breanna Binder on the characterizing the X-ray properties of Intermediate-MAss Pre-Main-Sequence Stars. I was named one of five undergraduates out of 100 to be a medalist for the Chambliss Astronomy Achievement Award.

## University of Wyoming REU

Summer 2016 I researched at the University of Wyoming with Postdoctoral Fellow Joe Findlay and Professor Adam Myers on observing the colors of high redshift-quasar candidates. The majority of the summer was spent observing, reducing data, and calibrating the data so that we could start data analysis. I lived the observational astronomers dream by being able to observe ~40 nights that summer! Almost every night was enjoyable except when there were clouds and when we had to take morning flats. Bleh. Overall, this was a great first experience for astronomical research.
