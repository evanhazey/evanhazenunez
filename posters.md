# Research Projects
*REU = Research Experience for Undergraduates*

## Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory REU
Summer 2018 I researched at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics with Professor Charlie Conroy and Postdoctoral Fellow Joel Leja on using [Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis](https://github.com/cconroy20/fsps) to constrain the ionizing photon budget of massive stars in distant galaxies. This was by far the most productive summer that I have had since this was my third consecutve astronomical research experience. I had a very fun summer and thoughtful summer because of the friends I made and my affiation with the [Banneker-Atzl√°n Institute](https://bannekerinstitute.fas.harvard.edu). I will present this research at the 233rd American Astronomical Society (AAS 233) National Conference in Seattle, WA January 2019. A requirement of the SAO REU is to write a paper on the research concucted over the 10-week long summer. This made the research cement into my head and encouraged deeper understanding of the topic.

## Cal Poly Pomona

Summer 2017 I began researching at my home institution Cal Poly Pomona with Professor Matthew Povich and Postdoctoral Fellow (now Assistant Professor) Breanna Binder on the characterizing the X-ray properties of Intermediate-Mass Pre-Main-Sequence Stars. I presented this work as a poster at two different conference. The first was at the AAS 231 in National Harbor, MD where I was named one of five undergraduates out of 100 to be a medalist for the Chambliss Astronomy Achievement Award. The second time was at the Chandra Workshop on Accretion in Stellar Systems in Cambridge, MA while I was researching at the CfA (above). This was my first topical conference and it was a blast!

## University of Wyoming REU

Summer 2016 I researched at the University of Wyoming with rofessor Adam Myers and Postdoctoral Fellow Joe Findlay on searching for high redshift-quasar candidates. The majority of the summer was spent observing, reducing data, and calibrating the data so that we could start data analysis. I lived the observational astronomers dream by being observing for ~30 nights that summer! Almost every night was enjoyable except when there were clouds and when we had to take morning flats. Bleh. Overall, this was a great first experience for astronomical research. I presented this research at AAS 229 in Grapevine, TX.
