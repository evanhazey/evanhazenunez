## SAO REU Paper Draft 

Summer 2018 I researched at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) through the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory REU program with Postdoctoral Fellow Joel Leja and Professor Charlie Conroy. A requirement of the program is for us to write a draft of the research that we conducted over the 10 week-long summer.
